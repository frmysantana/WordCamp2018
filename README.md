# WordCamp2018

### Background about the project
I tried to get involved in a project to re-style the WordCampNYC 2018 website. The coordinator showed me the design for the homepage that a designer also involved in the project had created.

Unfortunately, due to a bit of misinterpretation on my part, I couldn't be part of the official project. However, since I already had the design I decided to make a static restyling of the home page to give a better demonstration of my current CSS skills.

### What I did
My contributions are in the WordCampNYC.html, styles(1).css, and responsive.js files. The code that I wrote in the html and css files are wrapped in comments beginning with 'F.S.' The 'responsive.js' file is code that a friend shared with me which I modified in order to get the page to be more responsive.

The styles work for screens widths of about 770px and up.
