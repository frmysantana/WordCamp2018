# WordCamp2018

### Background about the project
I tried to get involved in a project to re-style the WordCampNYC 2018 website (see the 2018-nyc-wc-original.png file to see what the site originally looked like). The coordinator showed me the design for the homepage that a designer also involved in the project had created (see the WCNYC2018-redesign.png file).

Unfortunately, due to a bit of misinterpretation on my part, I couldn't be part of the official project. However, since I already had the design I decided to make a <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/frmysantana/WordCamp2018/blob/master/WordCampNYC.html" target="_blank">static restyling of the home page</a> to give a better demonstration of my current CSS skills.

### What I did
My contributions are in the WordCampNYC.html, styles(1).css, and responsive.js files. The code that I wrote in the html and css files are wrapped in comments beginning with 'F.S.' The 'responsive.js' file is code that a friend shared with me which I modified in order to get the page to be more responsive.

The styles work for screen widths of about 770px and up on Google Chrome (at least v68), Mozilla Firefox (at least v61), Microsoft Edge (at least v42), and Internet Explorer 11.
